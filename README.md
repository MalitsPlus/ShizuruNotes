# ShizuruNotes
An unofficial Android tool application of the game "Princess Connect Re:Dive".

## Requirement
* Android 8+  
> If you are located in Chinese mainland, it is highly recommend you to set ShizuruNotes and system download manager to go through your proxy software since there are some **UNKNOWN** reasons that you may get holy terrible connection speed to Github while ShizuruNotes will try to connect Github to fetch update information every time it is launched. 

## Build
Builded on Android Studio 3.6 RC 3.  
Gradle building configuration could be found in `./app/build.gradle` and it might be changed time to time.
